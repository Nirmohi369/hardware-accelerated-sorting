We met with professor Hang Liu to discuss about Vitis software. He guided us on which software to install.
We completed setting up our environment to code, that is installed vitis. Also, learned VHDL and vitis bascis from link provided by Professor Hang Liu.
This week we will be implementing our code in vitis software.
Brad visited the lab to find if any FPGA is available or not. It turns out that Prof Hang Liu already gave the FPGAs to other class.
